# Learning logs: week 1 @ ETH

- Tightening fundamentals and setting up routines.
- Wrote a tiny spaced‑repetition helper for definitions.
- Notes on balancing exploration with depth.

## What I focused on
- Complexity and data structures refresh
- Revisited Python/TypeScript idioms
- Small scripts to cut friction

## Spaced‑repetition helper
I wrote a quick exporter that turns definitions into CSV so I can batch review on the train.

```text
term,definition
idempotency,An operation that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application
```

## Balancing exploration with depth
Openness is great—reliability comes from finishing work. My rule this week: one new idea in, one small artifact out.
