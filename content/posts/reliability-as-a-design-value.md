# Reliability as a design value

Reliability isn't invisible; users *feel* it.

## Small choices, big outcomes
- Idempotent handlers gate side‑effects
- Retry with jitter avoids thundering herds
- Timeouts and backpressure protect upstreams

> Prefer predictable behavior over cleverness. Calm tools earn trust.

## Surface reliability in the UI
With dependable foundations, you can design reassuring affordances on top—progress that doesn't lie, states that don't flicker, and errors that teach.
